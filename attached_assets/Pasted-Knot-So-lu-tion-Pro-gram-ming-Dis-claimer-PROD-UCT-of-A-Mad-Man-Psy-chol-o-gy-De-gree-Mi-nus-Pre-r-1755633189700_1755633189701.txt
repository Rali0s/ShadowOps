“One can en­gage in a Ja­son Bourne like trig­ger by us­ing the MK-Ul­tra Project and
1 to 3 ex­ter­nal or in­ter­nal stim­uli an­chors as an in­cep­tion point to op­er­ate in a la­tent
men­tal schema that was pre­vi­ous­ly learned in a THETA lev­el state dur­ing con­scious
dai­ly life.”
De­fi­ni­tions:
Ma­te­ri­als:
1. ECG - Ba­se­li­ne - Re­vi­ew Bo­ard | EMO­TIV EPOCH
2. EN­DEL Sound App for Brain States
3. Track Book and Log
De­sign:
1. 1 Week Du­ra­tion of Flow State
2. 3 Day Du­ra­tion
3. 24 Hr Du­ra­ti­on
4. 1 Hr Du­ra­ti­on
5. De­sign of a SCHEMA:
Meth­ods:
1. Record­ing of SCHEMA for THETA State Play­back
2. Hyp­no­sis Pro­fes­sion­al Help for In­duc­tion Process Method
3. Have Exit: Back-Tap or Flash­light dur­ing FLOW state
4. Dif­fe­rent SCHE­MA de­signs and pur­po­ses A,B,C
5. Map­ping And De­sign of SCHEMA

6. Im­ple­men­ta­tion Of SCHEMA: How to speak it to self or per­form sug-
gestions - MISS­ING or UN­KNOWN

3

Pro­cess:
1. Cre­ate De­sired Schema or Mind­set A - Have Con­trol B
2. Record de­sired re­sult or out­comes of SCHEMA A
3. Prac­tice Med­i­ta­tion to en­ter THETA Lev­el Sleep
4. Meth­ods of In­tro­duc­ing Pre­fab­ri­cat­ed SCHEMA
5. Add at end of SCHEMA In­duc­tion: Add an­chor or trig­ger event or ob­ject
re­call - Ex: What Re­vibe Ther­a­py did to me with the in­ter­nal dial and vis­ual
phys­i­cal at­trib­ut­es to me, or car­ing less about every­one else. ( Plus: It just
worked now )
6. Trig­ger Event or Ob­ject-Re­call will al­low for the sub­ject to drop down into
the pre­set and sug­gest­ed schema ful­ly.
7. Exit Flow Pro­gram­ming States -
7.1 Flow­Gate­Pro­cess­ing: Flash­light on Phone = Al­ways On In­di­ca­tor
and OFF when com­plet­ed Flow State
7.2 Drop­Gate­Pro­cess­ing En­trance: Ex­ter­nal Trig­ger ( Sound: Old
CIS­CO Phone from 90s ) which brings about an TRUE or VALID
state OF en­ter­ing new or old LA­TENT and/or HID­DEN SCHEMA
of THOUGHT, PRO­CESS­ING, and or RE­SPONS­ES ( avoid­ing the
word AC­TIVE for AA analy­sis and cross de­f­i­n­i­tions and mean­ing )
7.3 Drop­Gate­Pro­cess­ing Exit:
7.3.1 Pru­dent to use In­ter­nal OFF con­cept or idea- po­ten­tial
is­sues with state re­call
7.3.2 Ex­ter­nal Stim­u­lus/Stim­uli - Coo­Coo Clock or unique
timer and sound trig­ger

7.3.3 Dead Bat­tery Backup - 2nd Par­ty or ( In­side Ex­per­i­ment
Per­sona Who Is In Knowl­edge but not in The Study )
with Exit Se­quence

8. Task Pro­cess­ing - Con­duct­ing Task be­fore Exit Se­quence
8.1 Ex­am­ple: Dur­ing One Hour Win­dow, Lo­cate Pa­per Hid­den, Write
Hid­den Word, place pa­per on de­sired ta­ble or lo­ca­tion, be­gin
EXIT process
8.2 Know­ing When task is com­plete > Drop into EXIT Schema
8.3 Build or NOR­MAL­IZE Sin­gu­lar EXIT PRO­TO­COL
9. Exit Pro­to­col Pro­ces­sing:
9.1 Task
9.2 Task Com­ple­tion
9.3 Exit DROP SCHE­MA
9.4 En­ter TIE Down State
10.TIE-Down or Knot­ted State:
10.1 Pur­pose: Pre­cent cog­ni­tive dis­so­nance ful­ly

10.2 Warn­ings: Longer the FLOW-STATE > More im­pact­ful or neg­a-
tive the Cog­ni­tive Dis­so­nance state af­ter Exit Drop Schema

10.3 Pro­to­col of TIE-DOWN STATE - A pre man­u­fac­tured way or
method to DE­BRIEF and nor­mal­ize sub­ject back into re­al­i­ty in a
safe and co­her­ent method
10.4 At­trib­ut­es: This may, if done cor­rect­ly, be a way to keep oth­er
FLOW-STATE goals in mem­o­ry cache out­side of wak­ing thought
or sub­con­scious.
10.5 GOAL: Op­er­a­tion Com­plet­ed - Brought Back to present time
and day and ground­ed in re­al­i­ty
